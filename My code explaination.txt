                 if we can connect to the server, then it will save data in MongoDB
                 if we r unable to connect to the server, then data will be stored as offline .below  code will serve the purpose.
                 (// fetch failed, so save in indexed DB
                 saveRecord(transaction);)
4. db.js - This file is used to check if we are back online so that all offline data will be pushed to MongoDB.

   // listen for app coming back online
   window.addEventListener("online", checkDatabase);
